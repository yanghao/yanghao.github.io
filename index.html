I love all kinds of cool tech stuff, from programming in general,
to software-defined-radio.

I love system design in general, especially things with very small turn-around
time (e.g. programming, small FPGAs). I had especially quite some experience in
building embedded systems from scratch (the REAL scratch where you own the very
first assembly instruction to a fully functioning operating system), automation
system and distributed systems. I mostly program in C and Python, playing
Arduinos/sensors/motors and Raspberry PIs, building small robot cars for me and
my son.

I live in Germany/Munich, if you have similar hobbies drop me an email.
I do not use any other social media except email, github and linkedin.
