<h1>a.out: command not found</h1>
<p>It is always difficult to get started with something you don't know at all.</p>
<p>I still remember after reading a lot of articles and books regarding UNIX and
GNU/Linux, I am fascinated with it. And I believed if I can get a hello world
working in GNU/Linux, I can do anything else too on GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>So I carefully crafted my first hello world in C with vim:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then I went on to compile it with GCC:</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc test.c
$ ls
a.out test.c
</code></pre>
<p>Looks all great, I generated my very first executable image from test.c, now
just need to run it:</p>
<pre><code>$ a.out
a.out: command not found
$ ls
a.out test.c
$
</code></pre>
<p>I became completely lost at this stage ... obviously I didn't know anything
about search path, I didn't even know there is the thing called environment
variables. All I did know is some basic C syntax and nothing more.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine at that time (2002/2003), the information on internet is
not that abundant and search didn't reveal any information on <code>$ a.out: command
not found</code>. After digging into a UNIX book in college library for a week I
noticed one example, instead of doing <code>$ executable</code> it did <code>$ ./executable</code>.
This is one of my most happy times ever, right away I realized the current
folder is not searched for <code>a.out</code> and I just need to type <code>$ ./a.out</code> instead to
get my first hello world working. Yay ~~~</p>
<h1>Why software engineer needs GNU/Linux</h1>
<p>GNU/Linux, and the entire open source community, is essentially becoming <strong>the
language</strong>. It is like English is a must-to-learn if you want to communicate
with rest of the world, GNU/Linux is the platform for the entire open source
community, and even M$ finally gives in and become one of the major contributor
to open source community, and its latest windows OS even supports a Linux
subsystem just to better support all those user space applications that was only
able to run on Linux can now also run on windows (my last try in 2017 shows
it still has a long way to go though, but definitely better than nothing).</p>
<p>GNU/Linux is still one of the most efficient operating systems out there,
completely free, super stable and reliable, runs across super computers, PC,
mobile phones and a lot more.</p>
<p>Having said all those good parts of GNU/Linux, this is not even the major reason
for software engineer to use GNU/Linux. In my view, the main reason is that
setting up a development environment on GNU/Linux is really easy, if not set up
by default. From console-based development, to IDEs, all you need to do is
something like <code>$ sudo apt install My-Loved-Application</code> and you are all done.</p>
<p>Using GNU/Linux means you invested yourself in something that has the biggest
scope and return in the future as a software developer.</p>
<h1>How should a newbie starts learning GNU/Linux</h1>
<p>Now looking back my old days, I really wish there was some UNIX guru around me
to point out this silly searching path issue. But in a M$-Windows dominated
environment, where almost every one is using graphical environment and IDEs, it
was not that easy to come across such a UNIX guru. I, somehow, always wanted the
hard way, because I always had this feeling that IDEs are cheating, not
clean, hard to reproduce the same thing. Astonishingly all those naive
feelings at that time proved all true even today. And after an amazing 15 years
of my first C hello world program, I am still not using any IDEs and still working
99% of the time in a text console, including right now writing this blog post
from a shell cnosole using vim.</p>
<p>The entire college culture doesn't really change even today in China. My cousin graduated
from college computer science major still knows very little about UNIX systems.</p>
<p>So, if you are a newbie and want to starts learning GNU/Linux and software
development in general, how do you get started by yourselves? Here is some
recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a GNU/Linux system at hand, with internet connections.</li>
<li>Understand the basic UNIX philosophy: everything is a file.</li>
<li>Learn the basic shell commands.</li>
<li>Understand the Operating System execution environment.</li>
<li>Pick up your favorite programming language</li>
<li>Write your first hello world</li>
<li>Run it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Congratulations, hopefully with only a few minutes, you stepped into the amazing
world of GNU/Linux and open source software.</p>
<h1>Recommendations on articles and books</h1>
<p>TBD.</p>
