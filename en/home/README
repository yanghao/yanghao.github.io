This is the home page of Hua Yanghao, documenting various technologies and ideas
which he wants to share with you.

It took some time to figure out what kind of site I want to build.
A site I understands every bit of it. First he tried Django, then google appengine.
But none of these work out so well. For the site I need is extremely simple to maintain,
yet fits well into the hands of a software developer. I don't have extra money
to rent big machines, so the site have to be able to service very well on low
end machines. It needs the flexibility to adopt changes quickly and update
automatically to reduce maintenance efforts. This is also a learning project
that I could explore what kind of issues I could encounter when design a high
performance website.

So I developed it from scratch, using webapp2 and webob python library, plus the
mako template engine, which I loves so much: now I can write template as writing
python code.

This is the place for fun, and hopefully you enjoyed your stay here.
