The journey of coding
=====================

I started coding since 2005, as the top bar implies.

I was eager to learn coding since I was 13 years old.
My cousin took me to her university lab where I had
touched the first computer I had ever seen. A box with
128 Mega bytes memory, which was considered "the best".

In 2000, my family bought me a computer! That was a
difficult decision to make, because it costs 7K RMB
at that time which was four months income of my father.
It comes with an Intel 500 Mega Hz CPU, 64 Mega bytes
memory and 10 Giga bytes storage, a builtin modem as well.
I knew this thing can create magic, but I don't know where
to start yet. I don't even know where to put the lines
that makes up the program. I heard my cousin mentioned
[fortran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran "Fortran"),
and something like "compiler", so I bought a CD that comes
with a fortran compiler, but still, how to get started??

Then I went to college, learned everything but programming!
I do have the "C programming" class in college, except writing
a "hello world", not really anything else funny. Then I heard
about "GNU/Linux", and there I tried to reproduce the "hello, world".
I edited the file, compiled the program with a compiler called "GCC".
And it indeed produced the executable file: a.out, but still,
it does not get executed! I typed "a.out" again and again,
but it always said "command not found". It is just there!!!
I do "ls" to prove that. I never knew the concept of "searching path"
before, until one day, at the corner of a UNIX programming book,
the auther used "./a.out" to execute the binary. There you go.
I cannot live without GNU/Linux from that day on.

But still, I was like a child searching in the dark, too many terminologies
I don't really understand. Besides, I was not good at English and
there's not really much materials in Chinese at that time.
I managed to gather all necessary concept together and had a deep
understanding on how UNIX systems works and how programming language
works eventually. I hate there are things I cannot even think of how it
is implemented, so I always dig deep enough until the last mysterious magic
is understood. And I was happy. Very happy.

But I get lost again. Programming is such a huge and general term.
From emdedded systems, to web applications, it is all programming.
And I finally realized knowing a specific programming language has
nothing to do with how to programming. I realized programming, like
any design activity, is the process to create. I finally realized that
why someone say **program = data structure + algorithm** and some one else
would argue **program = data structure**. And when why the hell
**when you in doubt, use brute force**.

Today, I'm not just coding useless shit anymore, I code in a modular way,
try as much as I can moving logic from code to **data**. I try to abstract
the essential problems from the one I'm facing, and make the code
ready to be used in general. I try to make it short and make it beautiful.

I believe this journey, which I enjoyed and suffered, will be interesting
to some one, especially those in China that was not as lucky as I was.
A chinese version will be followed soon.

This cateory (coding) will be the documentation of what I believe a good
plan to learn programming. Not just how to learn coding, but how to design
by coding. The art in coding is pretty much the same art in painting and music.
