Open Source Technology
======================
It is hard to believe that open source projects can be as successfull as it is today.
When [Richard Stallman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman)
first started the [GNU project](http://gnu.org), he wanted something freely
available for himself. He might have seen the needs for a few hackers, I'm not
really sure if he visioned open source technology can become such an important
ecosystem and the *only* environment for cross-company cross-nation cooperation
on huge and complex projects.

Today open source technology is powering up the world, even though you might not
aware of that. Every click you made on the web, it is most likely served by an
open source operating system and software stack in the background. And even the
most popular phone OS Android is based on the Linux kernel.

I loved programming so much because of open source projects, especially the
GNU/Linux system gave me the believe that it is not that difficult to be a
software engineer. Afterall, I spend no money and get my first "Hello World!" C
program up and running. I was not able to buy M$ compilers and I might end up
with something else completely if M$ was the only choice to go.

I live on open source project, and contribute my own open source project
whenever possible.
