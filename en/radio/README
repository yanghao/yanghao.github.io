Radio: Reach out the universe with the speed of light
=====================================================
I still remember the first radio I made by hand, with many discrete parts
soldered on a PCB board. But there is a pre-soldered SONY chip on the PCB, which
makes it impossible if you ever wanted to understand every single part of it.
The chip is just too complicated to understand.

Radio was considered very hardware bounded
technology. You need Radio Frequency front end,
you need specialized digital signal processing hardware,
and then comes some higher level software stuff.

But now, with the concept of SDR (Software Defined Radio),
it all changed. As now the personal computer processing
power (together with the parrallel processing power of graphics engine),
many radio technologies that was once existed only on
dedicated hardware can now also be implemented in pure software.
Heard about LTE? [Fabrice Bellard implemented a LTE base station in
software](http://bellard.org/lte/ "LTE in Software").

The even more exciting thing is, with USRP you can afford
such an SDR platform just at home. Oh yes, you still need
some hardware for SDR, but basically the hardware does is to
down convert the radio fequency signal to base band frequency signal
and sample the base band signal with a very high speed analog to
digital converter and vice versa.

When I think about making things happen in software compared with specialized
hardware, the meaning is far more than just easy to adapt quickly, much shorter
turn around time and so on. A much more important meaning behind this is,
implemention in software can easily reach millions of people because it is
extremely easy to duplicate. Whereas the magic burried in hardware is much more
difficult to reach out to a wide audience and uncover its logic. This means
software implementation is much easier for knowledge transfer, which can greatly
speed up new technology community growth and eventually make the technology
itself evolving much faster. It could even have a similar significance as the
open source initiative.

This section is all about softare-defined radio technologies. Radio technology
using dedicated hardware will go to the *Device* section.
