Web Technology. In Python.
==========================
The web is exciting. So is building your own website.
With a 2.63 giga herts single core cpu, 512 MB
memory, what kind of web site can I build? and how
many requests it can serve in 1 seconds?

This site is built with few dozen lines of Python code, yet are able to serve
very well hundreds of request per second. It is caching and nginx none-blocking
IO model that made resources consumed on the serve by each connection to a
minimum.

This section discusses all kinds of (mostly Python oriented) web technologies
that are used for building high performance website.
