Computer is everywhere!
=======================
Nowadays a 25$ Raspberry PI is more powerfull
than my first computer which cost 1000$. When
computers become that cheap, magic can happen, just like
when a CPU can compute 1 + 1 fast enough magic can happen.

You can automate your home. You can have all kinds of sensors
connected to your extremely low power and high performance
and mobile device, and the device can do a lot of things
and send the report to you via email. You can feed your dog
automatically, water your yard automatically (and intelligently).

This place will share with you all the fun projects related
to embedded systems.
