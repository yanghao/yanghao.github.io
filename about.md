Finally github pages + Jekyll build website the way engineers ever wanted.

You edit, you commit, you push. And you are done. This made building a web page
exactly the same way as you build a software. All with git and with git alone.

What's even better is, all the hosting is free, you just need a domain main
pointing to your github pages.

If you are a developer, git it a try you will love it.

EOF.
